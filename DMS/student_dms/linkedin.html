      <h2>How to create a profile that will get you hired.</h2><br>
      <h4>LinkedIn is a professional social networking platform. It allows you to look for jobs, for companies to find new employees and for you to stay connected and up-to-date about your industry. 
    When searching for a job, having a strong LinkedIn profile is just as important as a resume.

  <p>
    LinkedIn automatically inserts your previous or current job title or education status, but you should change that.
Use a title that shows what you want to be known for.<br><br>

Use searchable keywords<br><br>

Here are a few examples to give you some inspiration:<br><br>

Hospitality professional with Front of House Operations experience<br>
Customer Relations Specialist | B2B Sales | Team Leader<br>
Food and Beverage Service professional | Banquet Service Trained<br>
Guest Services expert with experience in large scale hotels/boutique residences/corporate sales and marketing<br>
Financial Management Enthusiast | Not-for-profit organization volunteer <br>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">A summary that sells<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-eye-open" style="float: right;"></span></button>
<div class="contentcc">
  <p>
Your LinkedIn summary depends on your objective. What is your passion and how does it drive your goal?<br>
<li>Tell a brief professional life story (give examples). It is much more personal than your resume objective.</li><br>
<li>Specify whether you are open to relocation or remote work</li><br>
<li>Use bullet points and short sentences</li><br>
<li>Speak in the first person</li><br><br><br>


Here is an example:<br>
I have always been passionate about connecting with others and expanding my world view. I believe that we learn and grow<br> from our interactions with others. For this reason, my career path has been in the hospitality industry, where I can <br>undertake many different roles and each day is a little different.<br>
<ul><li>I was promoted to Customer Service Team Leader within 6 months because of my customer satisfaction results</li><br>
<li>I am praised for my motivation, professional attitude and ability to think fast!</li><br>
<li>I thrive in a role that allows me to see real results and achieve positive feedback</li><br>
<li>Experienced in CRM software, Oracle and onboarding new team members</li><br><br></ul>

Keen to join a team that works together to provide memorable and outstanding service.<br><br> 
________________________________<br>
Planning, organization and supporting others have always been strengths that I am proud of.<br>
I am an administrator with experience in various industries, various management levels and demands. It has given me <br>excellent insight into what is most effective to ensure smooth processes and great communication for all. I am confident <br>that this dynamic and broad experience has given me a formula to carry with me into any job role. <br>
I always want to improve and learn new ways of doing things, to continue learning new skills. <br>

Experience and Education <br>
Your Education and Experience sections should reflect what is on your resume. <br><br>
<li>List your current and previous jobs, in reverse chronological order</li><br>
<li>Find the exact company with the correct logo if you can</li><br>
<li>List all of your relevant experiences that relate to your goal</li><br>
<li>10 years’ maximum</li><br>
<li>List some responsibilities, not everything</li><br><br>


Skills<br><br>

Don’t skip this section! You can add up to 50 skills. It will help recruiters find you based on the skills on your profile<br> - you will appear in more searches each week!<br>
LinkedIn will also recommend jobs to you, based on the skills on your profile.<br><br>

If you are not sure what to write:<br>
<li>Look at the skills on someone who has a job you would like to do</li><br>
<li>Look at the skills and requirements on a job description that interests you</li><br><br>

You can also ask friends, coworkers and classmates to endorse your skills (confirm that they are true!)<br><br>

Recommendations<br>
Have you ever written a review on Google for a product or a service? Well imagine the same thing, but you are the product!<br>
Ask a coworker, classmate, instructor or ex-colleague to write a few good words about you and your abilities. <br><br>

Top tips!<br>
<li>Be proactive… Consistently!</li><br>
<li>Update your settings and privacy</li><br>
<li>Send a message when your connect with someone or after they accept.</li><br>
<li>“Hi, I noticed that you have really interesting experience in the xxxxxx industry. I would love to connect as we have a similar background and field of work. Have a great week.”</li><br>
<li>Write posts, share posts, share articles</li><br>
<li>If you have an online portfolio….. share it!</li><br>
<li>Include your LinkedIn profile in your resume, cover letter and emails to employers</li><br>
